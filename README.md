## Restaurant Page 

A project from [The Odin Project - JavaScript Full Stack Track Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page). 

It is the layout for a potential restaurant page - although I believe that the structure and deisgn I have created can be applied to other use cases. For example a personal/ services page. 

The goal of the project was to build an application using ES6 module structure and gain familiarity using webpack. 


#### Skills demonstrated
- Webpack 
- ES6
- DOM Manipulation 
- application of aria-attributes for accessibility

- I also aimed to use objects and incorporate factory functions in order to practice creating reusable, DRY code. 

##### Next Refactor Steps / notes 
- There is some repetition of code across the tabs. I will aim to create another module to place these functions. 

#### Reflections
This was a fun project completed in 1.5 days. It is my first time building a project using ES6 modules - it is a great way to organise code. Furthermore, I enjoyed thinking about how I can practice the efficient storage and use of data such as the menu and contact information. Additionally, I realise that I enjoy minimal designs.
After completing this project I went back to consider accessibility - I did a major refactor to ensure accessibility had been fully considered and implemented. 
    - I changes photo and background colour. From very bright colours with low contrast to more neutral colours with high contrast font. 
    - added aria-labels and javascript to allow for focus and selection of tabs
Thinking about accessibility lead me to thinking more about the structure, html tags and using clear language  which in turn makes the code better in general
