## Restaurant Page 

A project from [The Odin Project - JavaScript Full Stack Track Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page). 

It is the layout for a potential restaurant page - although I believe that the structure and deisgn I have created can be applied to other use cases. For example a personal/ services page. 

The goal of the project was to build an application using ES6 module structure and gain familiarity using webpack. 


#### Skills demonstrated
- Webpack 
- ES6
- DOM Manipulation 

- I also aimed to use objects and incorporate factory funcitons in order to practice creating reusable, DRY code. 

##### Next Refactor Steps / notes 
- There is some repetition of code across the tabs. I will aim to create another module to place these functions. 

#### Reflections
This was a fun project completed in 1.5 days. It is my first time building a project using ES6 modules - it is a great way to organise code. Furthermore, I enjoyed thinking about how I can practice the efficient storage and use of data such as the menu and contact information. Additionally, I realise that I enjoy minimal designs.

Thinking about accessability lead me to thinking more about the structure, html tags and using clear language  which in turn makes the code better in general
